## Usage

### Extension registration

config.neon:

```neon
extensions:
	# Nette 3.0+
	rabbitmq: Contributte\RabbitMQ\DI\RabbitMQExtension

	# Nette 2.4
	rabbitmq: Contributte\RabbitMQ\DI\RabbitMQExtension24
```

### Example configuration

```neon
services:
	- TestConsumer

rabbitmq:
	connections:
		default:
			user: guest
			password: guest
			host: localhost
			port: 5672
			lazy: false

	queues:
		testQueue:
			connection: default
			# force queue declare on first queue operation during request
			# autoCreate: true

	exchanges:
		testExchange:
			connection: default
			type: fanout
			queueBindings:
				testQueue:
					routingKey: testRoutingKey
			# force exchange declare on first exchange operation during request
			# autoCreate: true

	producers:
		testProducer:
			exchange: testExchange
			# queue: testQueue
			contentType: application/json
			deliveryMode: 2 # Producer::DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT

	consumers:
		testConsumer:
			queue: testQueue
			callback: [@TestConsumer, consume]
			qos:
				prefetchSize: 0
				prefetchCount: 5

# Enable tracy bar panel
tracy:
	bar:
		- Contributte\RabbitMQ\Diagnostics\BarPanel
```

### Declaring Queues and Exchanges

Since v3.0, all queues and exchanges are by default declared on demand using the console command:

```bash
php index.php rabbitmq:declareQueuesAndExchanges
```

It's intended to be a part of the deploy process to make sure all the queues and exchanges are prepared for use.

If you need to override this behavior (for example only declare queues that are used during a request and nothing else),
just add the `autoCreate: true` parameter to queue or exchange of your choice.

You may also want to declare the queues and exchanges via rabbitmq management interface or a script but if you fail to
do so, don't run the declare console command and don't specify `autoCreate: true`, exceptions will be thrown when
accessing undeclared queues/exchanges.

### Publishing messages

services.neon:

```neon
services:
	- TestQueue(@Contributte\RabbitMQ\Client::getProducer(testProducer))
```

TestQueue.php:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Contributte\RabbitMQ\Producer\Producer;

final class TestQueue
{

	/**
	 * @var Producer
	 */
	private $testProducer;


	public function __construct(Producer $testProducer)
	{
		$this->testProducer = $testProducer;
	}


	public function publish(string $message): void
	{
		$json = json_encode(['message' => $message]);
		$headers = [];

		$this->testProducer->publish($json, $headers);
	}

}
```

### Publishing messages in cycle

Bunny does not support well producers that run a long time but send the message only once in a long period. Producers often drop connection in the middle but bunny have no idea about it (stream is closed) and if you try to write some data, an exception will be thrown about broken connection.
Drawback: you must call heartbeat by yourself.
In the example below, you can see that Connection::sendHearbeat() is callen in every single cycle - that is not a problem as internally, `contributte\rabbitmq` will actually let you send the heartbeat to rabbitmq only once per 1 second.

LongRunningTestQueue.php:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Contributte\RabbitMQ\Producer\Producer;

final class LongRunningTestQueue
{

	/**
	 * @var Producer
	 */
	private $testProducer;
	
	/**
     * @var DataProvider Some data provider 
     */
	private $dataProvider;
	
	/**
     * @var bool 
     */
	private $running;


	public function __construct(Producer $testProducer, DataProvider $dataProvider)
	{
		$this->testProducer = $testProducer;
		$this->dataProvider = $dataProvider;
	}
	
	public function run(): void {
	    do {
	        $message = $this->dataProvider->getMessage();
	        if (!$message) {
	            $this->testProducer->sendHeartbeat();
	            continue;
	        }
	        
	        $this->publish($message);
	    } while ($this->running);
	}


	public function publish(string $message): void
	{
		$json = json_encode(['message' => $message]);
		$headers = [];

		$this->testProducer->publish($json, $headers);
	}

}
```


### Consuming messages

Your consumer callback has to return a confirmation that particular message has been acknowledges (or different states -
unack, reject).

TestConsumer.php

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Bunny\Message;
use Contributte\RabbitMQ\Consumer\IConsumer;

final class TestConsumer implements IConsumer
{

	public function consume(Message $message): int
	{
		$messageData = json_decode($message->content);

		$headers = $message->headers;

		/**
		 * @todo Some logic here...
		 */

		return IConsumer::MESSAGE_ACK; // Or ::MESSAGE_NACK || ::MESSAGE_REJECT
	}

}
```

### Running a consumer trough CLI

There are two consumer commands prepared. `rabbitmq:consumer` wiil consume messages for specified amount of time (in
seconds), to run indefinitely skip this parameter. Following command will be consuming messages for one hour:

```bash
php index.php rabbitmq:consumer testConsumer 3600
```

Following command will be consuming messages indefinitely:

```bash
php index.php rabbitmq:consumer testConsumer
```

`rabbitmq:staticConsumer` will consume particular amount of messages. Following example will consume just 20 messages:

```bash
php index.php rabbitmq:staticConsumer testConsumer 20
```
